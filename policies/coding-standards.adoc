= Coding standards

The low-level coding conventions for the Hacks.js project are encoded in a shareable ESLint config.

In general, we prefer terse declarative code over a verbose imperative style. But we err on the side of clarity over brevity.

We err on the side of convention over configuration, yet the level of abstraction is low and transparent â€“ no black magic or idiosyncratic ideas.

Complexity of the overall system is reduced by consistent formatting and identifier naming, and by relying on a small pool of evergreen design patterns.
