= Run-scripts

Each link:../overview/package-repository.adoc[package repository] includes a suite of run-scripts to automate repeatable aspects of the package's development life cycle.

Run-scripts are commands that are executed using `npm run` from the context of the repository's directory. They are defined in the repository-level `package.json` manifest, against the `scripts` key. For more information, see the https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts[NPM docs].

Available run-scripts include `npm run build` and `npm run test`. Details of available run-scripts are included in the following documents:

* link:./building.adoc[Building]
* link:./testing.adoc[Testing]
