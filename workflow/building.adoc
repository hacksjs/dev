= Building

Hacks.js source code is written in modern ECMAScript syntax and uses the latest language APIs. Some of these features are not yet supported by the project's target runtime environments. In addition, we encoded TypeScript-compatible type definitions in JSDoc comments, and these need to be parsed and transformed into type definition files (`*.d.ts`) for distribution.

For these reasons, a build step is require.

Source-to-source transpilation is handled by https://babeljs.io/[Babel]. Type definition files are generated by the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`.

TODO: For the `@hacksjs/web` package we also produce a bundle for direct import into web pages via `<script>` tags. Module bundling is handled by Rollup.

For all the link:../overview/package-repositories.adoc[Package repositories], a full clean build of the package can be created automatically by running the `build` command:

----
npm run build
