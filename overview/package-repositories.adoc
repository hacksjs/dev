= Package repositories

The `@hacksjs/*` link:./packages.adoc[packages] are maintained independently of one another. For this reason, rather than using a mono-repo, each package is encapsulated in a dedicated repository.

The package repositories are:

* https://github.com/hacksjs/node
* https://github.com/hacksjs/universal
* https://github.com/hacksjs/web
