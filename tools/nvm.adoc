= Node Version Manager (NVM)

It is RECOMMENDED to use Node Version Manager (NVM) — there are different versions of this program for https://github.com/creationix/nvm[Unix-based systems] and for https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[Windows] — to manage the installation of multiple Node versions on your computer. Using NVM will make it easier for you to switch to the right version of Node when working across multiple projects.
